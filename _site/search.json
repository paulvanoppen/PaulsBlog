I have a passion for data analysis and R.\nI write about data analysis, life (a Dutch person living in Australia), places I visit and anything else that comes into my mind.\nWriting a blog is a challenge for me: I am mostly not a ‘wordy’ person with the exception of topics that I deeply care for. Working on this blog is scary in a sense as it exposes a lot of me to the world. Some of my reasons to do so:\n\nOrganise my mind."
