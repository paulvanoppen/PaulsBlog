# About me

My name is Paul van Oppen and I am an engineer. I have been in quality management for a long time. Working all of my life in the high-tech sector in Europe, China and Australia. I have a passion for data analysis and R.

I write about data analysis, life (a Dutch person living in Australia), places I visit and anything else that comes into my mind.

Writing a blog is a challenge for me: I am mostly not a 'wordy' person with the exception of topics that I deeply care for. Working on this blog is scary in a sense as it exposes a lot of me to the world. Some of my reasons to do so:

-   Organise my mind.
-   Learn how to write
-   Share knowledge
